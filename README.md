# cip-pytorch-minimal
A set of minimal tutorials for setting up and using Pytorch on the CIP computers at LMU

The aim is to collect here worked out tutorials and use cases for methods we are actively looking to apply for cosmological data

Initial tests to include:

* GAN
* cGAN
* Normalizing flows
